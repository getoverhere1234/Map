Certainly! Let's break down the provided code step by step:

Step 1: Import Required Libraries
python
Copy code
import streamlit as st
import folium
import pandas as pd
from streamlit_folium import folium_static
streamlit: Streamlit library for creating web apps.
folium: Folium library for creating Leaflet maps.
pandas: Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis.
folium_static: A helper function from the streamlit_folium package to display Folium maps in Streamlit apps.
Step 2: Define the Main Function
python
Copy code
def main():
    st.title("Soil Status Map")
Define the main() function.
Set the title of the Streamlit app to "Soil Status Map".
Step 3: File Uploader Widget
python
Copy code
    # File uploader widget
    uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Choose a CSV file", type=["csv"])
Create a file uploader widget that allows users to upload a CSV file.
The accepted file type is CSV.
Step 4: Check Uploaded File and Process Data
python
Copy code
    if uploaded_file is not None:
        # Read data from uploaded CSV file
        data = pd.read_csv(uploaded_file)
Check if a file has been uploaded.
If a file is uploaded, read the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame named data.
Step 5: Validate Required Columns
python
Copy code
        # Check if the required columns are present
        if 'Latitute' in data.columns and 'Longititude' in data.columns and 'Code' in data.columns:
Check if the uploaded CSV file contains the required columns: 'Latitute', 'Longititude', and 'Code'.
Step 6: Create Folium Map
python
Copy code
            # Create a base map
            m = folium.Map(location=[data['Latitute'].mean(), data['Longititude'].mean()], zoom_start=10)
Create a base Folium map centered at the mean latitude and longitude of the uploaded data with a zoom level of 10.
Step 7: Add Markers to the Map
python
Copy code
            # Add markers to the map based on the data
            for index, row in data.iterrows():
                folium.Marker(
                    location=[row['Latitute'], row['Longititude']],
                    popup=f"Code: {row['Code']}",
                    icon=folium.Icon(color='red' if row['Code'] == 1 else 'blue' if row['Code'] == 2 else 'green')
                ).add_to(m)
Iterate through the rows of the DataFrame and add a marker for each row to the Folium map.
The marker location is based on the 'Latitute' and 'Longititude' columns.
The marker popup displays the 'Code' value.
The marker icon color is determined by the 'Code' value (red for 1, blue for 2, and green for others).
Step 8: Display the Folium Map in Streamlit
python
Copy code
            # Display the map using folium_static
            folium_static(m)
Use folium_static from the streamlit_folium package to display the Folium map in the Streamlit app.
Step 9: Handle Missing Required Columns
python
Copy code
        else:
            st.warning("The uploaded CSV file does not contain the required columns: 'Latitute', 'Longititude', 'Code'.")
If the uploaded CSV file does not contain the required columns, display a warning message in the Streamlit app.
Step 10: Main Execution
python
Copy code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Execute the main() function when the script is run.
That's a step-by-step explanation of the provided code! Let me know if you have any questions or if any part needs further clarification.
